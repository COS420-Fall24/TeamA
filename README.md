## Problem Statements

1.
People struggle to keep track of their budgeting and financing. For example, many college students spend tons of money on unnecessary expenses such as DoorDash when they need to save money for rent and tuition causing them to be late on payments or go further into debt. Budgeting methods such as spreadsheets or other apps can be used to keep track of finances. However, spreadsheets are not organized and other budgeting apps are paid products. How do we design a budgeting app that is free and easy to use?

2.
Picking out outfits in the morning is time-consuming and stressful. For example, when running late class it is hard to find a good outfit for the weather and is stylish. This can cause you to be late to class and or frostbite. Current outfit planners exist and can save you time and effort in getting dressed. However, they are all subscription-based, don't account for weather, and potentially share your information. How do we create an outfit planner that's free to use and automatically accounts for the weather?
