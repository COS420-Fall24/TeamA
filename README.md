Low income and neurodiverse students in Maine encounter barriers to getting a job in tech. These jobs in tech could help them get out of poverty, contribute to economic justice in their community, and help them build tech that serves their communities better. However, to succeed, they must have awareness and belief that tech is a feasible option, know the overall process and information for each step of that process to ultimately get a job, and get social support and networking with peers and mentors. Without family members or people in their network in tech, they don’t know what to search for and that tech could be an option for them. Even when they know it’s an option, getting internships and experience to get a tech job requires knowledge about resumes, online assessments, how to find internships, and how to learn programming. Even if they search for that and find that information, it is not customized to the unique needs and concerns of lower-income and neurodiverse people in Maine, who may doubt they can succeed in tech. By using the incorporation of generative ai we can help neurodiverse students with their interpersonal office communications. While also providing resources for mentors, job availability, interview prep, and free learning resources.
